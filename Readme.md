This project tries to blindly detect whether the smartphone is in the hands of the driver or passenger. Further, it also generates an alert whenever a driver is engaged in some fatal activities with the mobile phone. 
Here, we collect the data from the application and sends it to backend for processing and estimation.
The backend after estimation generates an alert for the user after an interval of 1 minute.
